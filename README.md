# InventoryTrackingApp
Inventory Tracking App designed to simplify and streamline the management of items in a warehouse, storefront, or home. Built using Java on Android Studio.

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The inventory tracking app I developed aims to simplify and streamline the management of items in a warehouse, storefront, or home. Our key requirements and goals for the app include:
- ***User-Friendly Interface***: The app is designed with a simple and intuitive interface to allow users to quickly log in, create an account, and manage their inventory items with ease.
- ***Inventory Management***: Users can view a comprehensive list of current inventory items, including item name, item ID, and item quantity. Users may also add, subtract, and delete items with a few quick taps.
- ***Design and Compatibility***:  The app features a sleek and modern design, with a purple and white color scheme, and an icon that clearly conveys its purpose. It supports a wide range of Android versions and devices to ensure broad accesiblity to a ton of potential users.
- ***Essential Permissions***: The app requests only necesary permissions for eseential functionality of the app, such as internet access for real-time updates, storage access for offline use, camera access for barcode scanning, and SMS notification access for low stock alerts.
- ***Monetization Strategy***: Utilizing a 'freemium' model, the app is free to download with essential functions available to all users. Future monetization may include premium features like barcode scanning and non-intrusive on-screen ads.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To support user needs and create a user-centered UI for the inventory tracking app, the following screens and features were essential in the development of the app:
- ***Login Screen***: Provides a simple and secure way for users to access their accounts
- ***Account Creation Screen***: Allows new users to create accounts easily and start using the app upon sign up
- ***Inventory List Display***: Displays a comprehensize list of inventory items which includes proper labeling for item name, item ID, and item quantity. This screen allows users to quickly get an overview of their inventory
- ***Item Management Features***: Functionality includes buttons for adding, subtracting, and deleting inventory items, enabling users to manage their inventory efficently with minimal effort
- ***SMS Notifications***: Sends SMS alerts when inventory items reach low stock levels, helping users stay on top of their inventory needs

When considering the UI design approach, I focused on simplicity and intuitiveness, ensuring users could navigate the app and perform the needed tasks with ease. The app utilizes consisent design elements and UI components to give users a familiar look on every new screen or activity. The UI elements are a sleek, modern purple and white color scheme that provides a visually appealing and cohesive user experience.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

When coding the inventory app, I adopted a structured approach to ensure the development of my app was efficient over the course of development. To begin, I started by clearly defining the app's requirements and goals, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of what needed to be built and what were the goals that app had for each of its users. As with any designing process, I created prototypes for the app's logic and UI design to help identify what I needed to dedicate more time for development, and how I would properly structure my app entirely. The app is built with ***modular development*** techniques that prioritize breaking down the app's functions into smaller, more manageable modules, such as the login, inventory activity, item management functions, and SMS notifications. With the modular approach, I was able to code in a more organized manner which in turn makes maintaining, debugging, and understanding the code uncomplicated. The code base was tested using manual testing, by conducting tests myself to catch issues that might arise during development. The techniques and strategies learned throughout this project could provide beneficial for me in my future as I can implement the techniques and methods on other coding projects moving forward.
